Hello!

The objectives I had for this weeks were:

- AVATAR OPTIMITATION PROBLEM WITH PYTHON -> TALK WITH ALEJANDRO

- Alejandro send me a repo called author tools: that internally downloads any scene you have locally so that you can use it in a Python environment.

The repository has a node module that communicates with the local Author app (author-tools). Notebooks must communicate with it through bash scripts (located in ./notebooks/scripts). Every new functionality must be implemented in this application. For example, a basic case that you will need to implement is that of obtaining a piece of the scene. It's pretty straightforward if you see how the arrange (./src/arrangePieces.js) or stats (./src/sceneStats) functionality is implemented, but basically author-tools would have to receive a path where the piece (or scene) will be written. ) in JSON form. This file can then be accessed from a cell on the notebook. Then another functionality should write a scene in Author with the new pieces (arrangePieces.js does this).
Also its given a basic example of running an optimizer with Adam using Pytorch.

The next week goals are:

- Understand author-tools and get my scene info.
- How to solve the Avatar garment fit?
- Talk with Ivan and Alex.
