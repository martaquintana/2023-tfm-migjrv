Hello! 

This week I had to do:
- Kibotics Robotica with Scratch & Drones with Scratch all exercises done, IR sensor doesnt work for Robotica con Scratch and Follow line with vision camera sensor in Drones neither if the drone takes off.

-Also I had to made the gripper work with HAL API in JavaScript but I'm a bit confused and since the octahedrons are independent from the robot, I don't know how to put them in the Robot API,
I have to create a message from the webworkers in the build folder ?? I hope get it this week.

- In Blender I have painted the robot Mbot base  so that the colors look much better I hope you like it
