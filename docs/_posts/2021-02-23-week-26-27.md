Hello! 

This week I had to do:
- AFRAME GRIPPER works more or less and it's ready to do the game.

Gripper in D1 Kibotics

<iframe width="150" height="100" src="https://youtube.com/embed/eVM9n4mziTQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-This weeks I have been studying how work the gripper and the most important problems that I have is when the turn left-right, I'm still trying to get the blades to move perpendicularly in D1 in kibotics.

The next improvements would be that the clamps are not on the ground, change the octohedra for blender models ... 

this next weeks I will tell you how I will improve the gripper
