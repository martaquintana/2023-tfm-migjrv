This week I read some TFGs to learn about the new tecnology I have to use in my TFG. I saw  videos from JdeRobot and Kibotics, all links are on the references page.
Also I investigate a little bit Aframe and Jupyter, and I practiced Python and Sratch exercices from Kibotics website.

The next week goals are:

- Create my TFG GitHub Pages (this one)
- Do a Django 2.2 Server
- Do a web page html5 with a button that when you click an audio is played.
