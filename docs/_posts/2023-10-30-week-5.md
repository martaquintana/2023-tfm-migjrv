Hello!

The objectives I had for this weeks were:
- Author code scheme --> In process to understand Components + Reducers + Actions + data storage
- Tests in Author --> I loaded some paterns and sewed them.
- Brouet paper summary for memory --> In process
- Update this blog --> Done!

I had a meeting with Alejandro to land on Author and then I sewed my first shirt:

The next week goals are:

- Investigate parametric editing on other platforms and document it for the state of the art of memory.
- Contextual editing in Seddi ask designers (We would be interested ask more than 7 designers) about how the editing of those parameters in Seddi would fit. (Add this to metodology in TFM memory).
- Modify the length of a t-shirt with a slider, be careful with the curvature, there are patterns that are not straight and you not only have to stretch the t-shirt, adjust it with grading rules.
