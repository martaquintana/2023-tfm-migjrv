This week I had to do:
1. Refine Acustic Teleoperator 

1.1. Teachable Machine --> 105 examples by word from 10 persons, you can try if this model recognizes your voice:
  https://martaquintana.github.io/Audio_Recognition/index.html
  
  Works well in Chrome, Firefox and some smartphones. 
 *We can add to the model the words in Spanish(?)
  
1.2. Button Connect/Disconnect to the Robot 
  
  This is the video of how works Teachable Machine and the actual Acustic Teleoperator with the button Connection to Robot(Green Connected/Red Disconnected):
  
  *I add more soundtracks with the credits to the artist (it's free licence know more here https://patrickdearteaga.com/es/index-es/) and I changed a little bit the code here is everything:
