Hello! 

This week I had done:
- First of all FINALLY the gripper turns right and left well,and the close open works well, the problem was the robot and the gripper parts weren't in collision and they need to be as near as posible to work well.
The close open problem is solved by init the robot 

- Circuit looks better know and I changed the cylinder by a can

- I create a Blender can and I put the JdeRobot colours but I have had to have some changes in the config file because my Blender model seems darker. 
 I fix it adding new point light and adding a new attribute in the scene. All changes in my gripper_config.json

This is how It looks like now and how works, I hope you like!
