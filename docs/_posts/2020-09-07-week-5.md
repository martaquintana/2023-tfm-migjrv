This month I had to do:

1. Starting with Tensorflow.js Tutorials (image recognition) --> TFJS Tutorials Youtube + Image Classifier 
2. Hello world Tensorflow.js Audio Recognition --> Tutorials Audio Recognition

For this 2 steps I did this video that shows what I did this weeks:

3. D1 Kibotics OK (Despligue a 1 de Kibotics  JavaScript Editor)--> Now it works) and Studying WebSim SIMCORE and A-Frame in Kibotics-WebSim : I don't really understand how it works



The next week goals are:

1. Understand the D1 Kibotics how works simcore, brains and JavaScrip-Editor.
2. Making a 'Acustic Teleoperator' Robot has to understand Go, Stop and other word for Back with the tutorial I made of TensorFlowjs audio recognition.
