Hello, blog reader!

I'm Marta Quintana, an [Audiovisual and Multimedia Systems Engineer](https://www.urjc.es/estudios/grado/637-ingenieria-en-sistemas-audiovisuales-y-multimedia). Last year I completed the master's degree in [computer graphics, games and virtual reality](https://www.urjc.es/estudios/master/908-informatica-grafica-juegos-y-realidad-virtual) at the URJC. 


I am currently doing my master's thesis in collaboration with the [Rey Juan Carlos University](https://www.urjc.es/) and [Seddi](https://seddi.com/).

The project is based on a web page to create garment patterns in real time in a parametric way, so that designers can make their designs and get their patterns ready to manufacture. The parametric adjustment will allow designers to adjust the patterns respecting their design in different sizes and in this way, respecting the environment by minimizing the materials that would have to be used in the design adjustment tests.

I will post the advances, problems and solutions about the project every week and I hope it will be nice to read and you can learn with me.

Ready for the adventure?


Marta.
