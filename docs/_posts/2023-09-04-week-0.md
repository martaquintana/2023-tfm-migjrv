Hello, Blog Readers!

I'm Marta Quintana, an [Audiovisual and Multimedia Systems Engineer](https://www.urjc.es/estudios/grado/637-ingenieria-en-sistemas-audiovisuales-y-multimedia). Last year, I completed the Master's Degree in [Computer Graphics, Games and Virtual Reality](https://www.urjc.es/estudios/master/908-informatica-grafica-juegos-y-realidad-virtual) at the URJC. 


Currently, I am working on my master's thesis in collaboration with [Rey Juan Carlos University](https://www.urjc.es/) and [Seddi](https://seddi.com/).

The project is centered around the creation of real-time garment patterns through a parametric approach on a web platform. This will enable designers to craft their designs and generate production-ready patterns. The parametric adjustments will empower designers to adapt patterns to various sizes while minimizing environmental impact by reducing the need for design adjustment testing materials.

I'll be sharing weekly updates on the project, discussing progress, challenges and solutions.
I hope you'll enjoy reading it and we can learn together.

Are you ready for the adventure?

Best regards,
Marta.
