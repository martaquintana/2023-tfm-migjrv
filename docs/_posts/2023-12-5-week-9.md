Hello!

The objectives I had for this weeks were:

- Modify the length of a t-shirt with a slider--> Change the position of the selected segment by an slider. Finally I better understand how seddi autor works, and I created a new tool called Parametric Tool to be able to modify the POSITION of the selected garment segment with the value of the slider. Currently without sewing.

The next week goals are:

- Modify the selected segment length not position (distance of two points with an slider).
- Study how to modify sewing segments.
- How to add new tool to create the POM points or improve some of the actual Tools.
