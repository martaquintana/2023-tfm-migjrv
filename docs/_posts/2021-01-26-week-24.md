Hello! 

This week I had to do:
- Create kibotics python and scratch units in kibotics-units, I made the issues ( #329  Roomba confetti new exercise Python & #330 Roomba confeti new exercise Scratch)
   I'm finishing to update the theory of the exercises and I almost got it. I'll made the pull request soon.
   {% include gallery caption="Theory + Roomba exercise + evaluator" %}
   
- Create evaluator widget in the exercises --> I create an evaluator where we have a 5 minute countdown and the confetti counter collected in that time.

  [Documented Internal(A-Frame) and External(Blender) Animations](https://github.com/jderobot-hub/kibotics-websim#animations-a-frame--blender-in-our-config-file-)
