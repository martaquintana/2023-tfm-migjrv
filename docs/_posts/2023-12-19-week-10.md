Hello!

The objectives I had for this weeks were:
- Modify the selected segment by length not a value (distance of two points with an slider)->Improve when I have the POM Tool optimized, for now I move some type of displacement value to move a multiple segments selected but not in centimeters. The multiple segments moves the same distance and to the same direction.
- Study how to modify sewing segments: study when we have the POM and Parametric Tool.
- How to add new tool to create the POM points or improve some of the actual Tools-> new Tool: POM Tool. In this two weeks I have been working on how add the Points Of Measure (POM), saving the selected segments and drawing an interiorLine to get the length.
The problem I have is that these points are in pattern coordinates when are selected and to draw the interiorLine properly, we need the points in worldspace coordinates. I'm working on it.



The next week goals are:

- POM Tool: draw the interiorLine in worldspace coordinates and save the two points or segments to move in the parametric Tool.
- Parametric Tool: Move the selected segments or POM , in the centimeters of the interiorLine and update the values and move same distance but diferent direction.
