- Roomba 3d A-Frame & 1 Confeti actuator suck confetti, remove Aframe world elements NEW.
   Now the Romba suck the confetti not by collision,but by position but confeti is in random position and random color and I made the new scene of a room.

-I could not advance with the clamp because Roberto hasn't answered me yet. 

The next week goals are:

- Clamp, object texture and mesh collision, animations and object that is moving all time
- Integrate new exercise in Kibotics
- More obstacles in the room (& json of confeti's positions)
