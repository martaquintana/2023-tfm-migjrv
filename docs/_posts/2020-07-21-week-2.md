This week I create my TFG GitHub Pages (this one) and a Django 2.2.10 Server as we do in LTAW class.
The web page html5 I did is a simple web with a button that when you click an audio is played and when you click again is paused and viceversa. 

This is the video of result:

The next week goals are:

- Audio Input,WebRTC Recording the microphone some seconds and store it in a variable or a file.
- Investigate about AUDIO PROCESING (without neuronal networks) in webrtc javascript and html5
- Do a world to practice A-Frame.
