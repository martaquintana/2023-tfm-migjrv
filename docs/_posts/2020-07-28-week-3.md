This week I did: 

1.Audio Input,WebRTC Recording the microphone some seconds and store it in a variable or a file.

I did an recorder where the data is stored in an variable using fictional urls. 

2.Investigate about AUDIO PROCESING (without neuronal networks) in webrtc javascript and html5 --> I found how to do a player, analizer and effects. Maybe we can try with a python library Â¿?

3.Do a world to practice A-Frame. 

Here is the things I did this week: Recorder + Aframe:
