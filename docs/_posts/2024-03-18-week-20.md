Hello!

The objectives I had for this weeks were:

- Import/export of the scene info from Author to Python Jupyter Notebook:
  I have managed to import the 2D and 3D garments into the scene with the JSON. I need to review some problems/errors that appear when I import more than one scene in the same session, and the stitching.

- I continue with the import, I'm going to see if I can add the seams, a problem that I have seen is that when adding the new garments the identifiers change and the poms do not make sense, if we only want to view the garment in the Author simulator ok, but If we want to see the updated poms and such, it's going to take a lot for me to adjust all that. Another problem that I have seen is that when importing the scene, even though you have adjusted it to the avatar with the arrangement, when you import it it is not done and the garment is placed in front of the avatar, I am with this too.

The next week goals are:

- Import/export of the scene info.
