Hello!

The objectives I had for this weeks were:

- POM TOOL: Define more than one POM, visualizate them  and redefine the data structure.-> I did a refactor in the POMs data structure to store all the necessary information. I have to review how to create dinamically and assifn correctly the sliders and parameters in React for UI User Interface I hope have it this week. Right now, I can paint two POMs and apply the same transformation to them  at the same time.
- PARAMETRIC TOOL: Movement in local coordinates, value based on cm of the interiorLine of the POM and slider value.-> Fixed, before there were more transformations than necessary, now the transform is in local coordinates.

- POM TOOL: Review interiorLines and set the correct slider value.
- Ask Harrison abot the UI POM/ PARAMETRIC TOOL DESING.
- PARAMETRIC TOOL: Review connections and how to manage the diferent times of POMS.
