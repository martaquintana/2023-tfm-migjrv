Hello!

The objectives I had for this weeks were:

- CHANGE INTERIOR LINES FOR NEW POM RENDERABLES -> For the actual situation in SEDDI, POM lines can be interior lines. It will be renderables in the future.
- Vertical lines-> when you edit horizontal POMS, vertical lines hit should change, now it becomes a diagonal and we don't want that.->SOLVED
- Review Cap width -> Weird  behaviour-> SOLVED THE DEFINED POM IN THE SEGMENT
- Implement Armhole Straight -> (NEW DIAGONAL LINES) Following the line of the as Harrison told me.-> Implemented new diagonal behaviour.
- Review connections -> if 2 POMs are connected, move it proportionally, not the same value.->  DONE
-> const longitudDeseada = poms[j].sliderValue*proporcion;
->const diferenciaLongitud = longitudActual - longitudDeseada;
