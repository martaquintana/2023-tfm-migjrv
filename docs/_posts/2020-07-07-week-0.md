Hello, blog reader!.

I'm Marta Quintana, student of a Degree in Audiovisual and Multimedia Systems Engineering [INGENIER√çA EN SISTEMAS AUDIOVISUALES Y MULTIMEDIA at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos](https://www.urjc.es/estudios/grado/637-ingenieria-en-sistemas-audiovisuales-y-multimedia).


I will post the advances, problems and solutions about the project every week and I hope it will be nice to read and you can learn with me.

Ready for the adventure?


Marta.
