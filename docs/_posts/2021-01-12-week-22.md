Hello! 

This week I had to do:
- Clamp, object texture and mesh collision, animations and object that is moving all time: I try to understand drone_animation.gltf and person animation with aframe but I don't understand it very well at all. 
Also I try to add animation in the config.json file but I couldn't.

- Integrate new exercise in Kibotics (when the exercise is completely finished)

- More obstacles in the room (& json of confeti's positions)  I added the mesh cllision in the chair, table, sofa legs and the balls now they aren't ghosts!! They are independent objects.
  The data.json has the array of positions x & z of the confetis, now all confetis are in the same position but each time you load it they are of different colors!
  
  {% include gallery caption="Json array of positions and new static objects with mesh collision" %}
