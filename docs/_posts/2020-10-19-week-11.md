This week I had to do:


 1.Read TFG kibotics analytics https://gsyc.urjc.es/jmplaza/students/tfg-kibotics-analytics-angel_perea-2020.pdf  --> More or less
 2. Make a Volumeter --> I made a HTML5 page https://martaquintana.github.io/Audio_Recognition/vumetro.html
 3. Install D3 Kibotics for competitions : I have just finish installing it today thanks to the help of Pablo.
 
*This week I had some problems with the memory and partitions of my laptop and I had to reinstall all Linux and Mac sistems. 

The next week goals are:
1. Refine Acustic Teleoperator including a Vumeter 
2. Gamming --> in my D3 record a video with the works of Async & Sync competive exercises for example the competition of F1.
