Hello!

Sorry for the delay in updating, this month I have been with the optimization solving some problems but finally it works, I have done the optimization problem with finite differences since with tensors the gradient was not calculated by itself, to calculate what should increase or reduce the pom to maintain the fit of the garment, horizontally and vertically.
In this video you can see the results that are expected.

What we are following this steps:
1. We have a base pattern of a female with 50 cm width and 60 cm height and we want to scale to diferent avatars preserving the fit. (We supose this t-shirt is fitting good for the female avatar)
2. Export sewn scene from Seddi Author to Python (Jupyter notebook) to do the optimization.
3. 3D proporciona scale to new avatar (Get target Edges strain)
4. Deform 2d patter to get similar edges target strain. Deformation done by finite differences to find the value to increase or decrease horizontal and vertical poms.
5. Come back to author an adjust the new values and sew again.

Here is the final code working  https://github.com/martaquintana/2023-tfm-migjrv/blob/main/optimization/author-tool-optimization.ipynb

And here the images of the results https://github.com/martaquintana/2023-tfm-migjrv/tree/main/resultados

The next week goals are:

- Write Memory -> I'll update the blog with the final version of the memory and presetation.
