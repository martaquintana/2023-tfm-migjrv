Hello!

The objectives I had for this weeks were:

- Iv√°n and I had a meeting to clean and do the export/import of a stitched scene in Author. What I was doing was more complex because I wanted to update the entire scene but in the end we only changed the geometry and the sew line of the garments. We are missing the avatar change that we didn't have time for and I'm going to see if I can update my branch to finish that, because I need some more permission to do the npm install.

On the other hand, the json that we export is composed of:

"""""

"avatar": {

     "indexes": [....],

     "positions": [.....]

},

"pieces": [

     {

       "_id": ....

       "components": {

...

           "geometry": {

             "indices": [...],

             "position2D": [...],

             "position3D": [...]

},{

(....with all the pieces)

},

"""""

I have created a Jupyter notebook where I am going to do the optimization, for now, I import the json data and convert it to numpy arrays and matrices and I am calculating the minimum distances between the avatar and the garment.

I have uploaded it to github: https://github.com/martaquintana/2023-tfm-migjrv/blob/main/optimization/author-tool-optimization.ipynb

The next week goals are:

- Avatar change
- Proporcional Scale
