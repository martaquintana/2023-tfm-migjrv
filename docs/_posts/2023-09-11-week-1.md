Hello!

The objectives I had for this week were:

- React Proyect + API Canvas: Draw and modify brezier curves
- Check Sandbox Bezier Curves in C++ Alejandro Graciano
- Search information about some tecnologies that I am going to use: Redux, typescript, clo3d, browzwear, Webassembly, webgl ...

First, I did a React Proyect using CANVAS API, where you can modify a cubic bezier curve paramethers, in this case the x,y coordinates of each control point. (Bezier Curves Canvas)[https://github.com/martaquintana/2023-tfm-migjrv/tree/main/bezier-curves-app]

I studied the TypeScript code from Alejandro, and I add another bezier path that you can draw the diferent beziers paths and link them so that when modifying the selected one, the other one moves the same way. (seddi-code-challenge)[https://github.com/martaquintana/seddi-code-challenge]

Also I did an other app, in this case with REACT + REDUX + TYPESCRIPT. I did a counter and a simple canvas that you can draw points on it.

The next week goals are:

- Redux, React + TypeScript with bezier curves
- Show and get the bezier curves lenght + escale operations
