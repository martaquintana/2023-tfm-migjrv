👋 Hi, I’m Marta Quintana Portales, an audiovisual and multimedia systems engineer specializing in computer graphics, games, and virtual reality.

👀 I’m interested in learning about 3D animation and visual effects.

🌱 I’m currently a part-time full-stack developer at Kibotics, where I'm learning web technologies, A-Frame, and robotics, while working on my final master's project in collaboration with URJC and Seddi.

🎨 I love art, nature, and photography.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games, websites, movies, or animation films.
